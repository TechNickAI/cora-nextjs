## Overview

Cora is a heart-centered AI assistant designed to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and enhance human potential. Named after the Latin word for "heart," Cora embodies our commitment to creating AI that is not just intelligent, but also empathetic, ethical, and aligned with human values.

Our vision is to develop an AI assistant that serves as a synergist between human creativity and technological capability. Cora is not just a tool, but a partner in your personal and professional growth, aimed at amplifying your effectiveness and helping you achieve a 100x improvement in various aspects of your life.

See [design.md](docs/design.md) for more details on the design and architecture.

## Ethos and Goals

At the core of Cora's development is the philosophy of Heart Centered AI, which seeks to create a harmonious intersection between humanity and technology. Our goals include:

1. Empowerment: Enhance human capabilities, allowing users to focus on high-level strategy and creativity.
2. Ethical AI: Ensure that AI development remains grounded in empathy and multi-variate values.
3. Personalization: Provide deeply tailored assistance by leveraging personal data responsibly.
4. Efficiency: Dramatically improve productivity by handling a wide range of tasks with varying complexity.
5. Innovation: Push the boundaries of what's possible with AI, particularly in entrepreneurial and creative domains.
6. Holistic Growth: Support users in achieving balance across all aspects of life, not just career or productivity.

## Installation and Setup

## Privacy and Security

Cora is designed with the highest standards of data privacy and security. While it leverages personal data for enhanced functionality, all information is processed securely, and users have full control over their data. This project is currently intended for use in a trusted environment and is not for public deployment.

## Coding Principles

Borrowed from the [zen of python](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonPhilosophy), with a couple of changes.

```text
1. **Readability is the number 1 code quality metric**.
2. Beautiful is better than ugly.
3. Explicit is better than implicit.
4. Simple is better than complex.
5. Complex is better than complicated.
6. Flat is better than nested.
7. Sparse is better than dense.
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    * Although practicality beats purity.
9. Errors should never pass silently.
    * Unless explicitly silenced.
10. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
11. There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
12. Now is better than never.
```
